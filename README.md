# Mecanum-Car
Built an Arduino-powered Mecanum wheel robot with dual L298N motor drivers for full 360Â° omnidirectional movement. Controlled via Bluetooth, it supports forward, backward, lateral, and diagonal motion. A modular platform ideal for robotics learning, control systems, and future AI integration.
