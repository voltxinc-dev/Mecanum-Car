# ü§ñ Arduino-Powered Mecanum Car

A DIY Arduino-based Mecanum wheel robotic car that can move in all directions using two motor drivers and standard hardware. Built for flexibility, maneuverability, and learning!

## üöó Project Overview

This project involves building a four-wheeled Mecanum car powered by an **Arduino UNO/Nano**, controlled via **Bluetooth** or **RC**, and driven using **two motor drivers (L298N or similar)**. The Mecanum wheels allow **omnidirectional movement**, enabling the car to move forward, backward, strafe sideways, and rotate.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Wiring Overview

- **Motor Driver 1** controls **Front Left** and **Rear Right** motors.
- **Motor Driver 2** controls **Front Right** and **Rear Left** motors.
- Each motor driver is connected to **Arduino PWM pins** for speed control.
- All grounds (motor drivers, Arduino, power source) must be connected.

> **Tip:** Use heat sinks and proper power regulation to prevent overheating.
